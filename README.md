This Python script demonstrates a simple image classification pipeline using transfer learning with the VGG16 model and logistic regression. The script loads a dataset of images, extracts features from the images using the pre-trained VGG16 model, splits the dataset into training and testing sets, trains a logistic regression classifier on the extracted features, and evaluates the model's performance on a validation set.

Image Classification with VGG16 and Logistic Regression

This Python script showcases a basic image classification pipeline using transfer learning with the VGG16 model and logistic regression. It utilizes popular libraries like NumPy, OpenCV, scikit-learn, and TensorFlow's Keras API to train and evaluate an image classifier.

The dataset used for training and validation is assumed to be organized in a folder structure, where each class has its own subfolder containing images of that class. The script automatically loads and processes the images, resizing them to match the VGG16 model's input size.

**Key Steps:**

**Data Loading and Preprocessing:**

Images from the dataset are loaded and preprocessed, converting them into NumPy arrays.
Labels are extracted and associated with each image.
**Feature Extraction using VGG16:**

The VGG16 model pre-trained on ImageNet is employed as a feature extractor.
Features are extracted from each image using the pre-trained VGG16 model, excluding the fully connected layers.
Extracted features are flattened to be compatible with the logistic regression classifier.
**Train-Test Split:**

The dataset is split into training and testing sets, with 80% of the data used for training and 20% for testing.
**Logistic Regression Classifier:**

A logistic regression classifier is initialized and trained on the extracted image features.
The classifier is then used to predict class labels for the test set and a validation set.
**Evaluation Metrics:**

The accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix are computed to evaluate the model's performance on the test and validation sets.
**Model Saving:**

The trained logistic regression classifier is saved using the joblib library for future use.
This script provides a solid foundation for building image classification models using transfer learning with VGG16. You can further explore and modify the script to experiment with different pre-trained models, explore other classifiers, or use different datasets to tackle various image classification tasks.

Feel free to use, modify, and share this script as needed, and happy classifying!
